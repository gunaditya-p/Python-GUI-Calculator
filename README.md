# Python-GUI-Calculator

I has just discovered "tkinter" the GUI module of Python and wanted to make something out of it by the end of the day. I decided to go with an arithematic calculator. The output shows a basic calculator GUI and a fully functional arithematic calculator which follows BODMAS rule.

I would also like to point out the eval() function. The eval function "evaluates" a string input. It not just solves Mathematical questions but can also run Python code. This posses a vulnerability while using the function as it may expose your sensitive code/files. Further Read : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/eval-in-python/
